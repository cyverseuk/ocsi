![badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/ImageInfo-_ago_796MB/_11_Layers_-blue.svg?style=flat-square)

The OCSI application developed at the University of Warwick can be run on the US hardware looking for the OCSI HPC DE application in the Discovery environment.

We integrate the same as an Agave application in the CyVerse UK ecosystem so that users have the choice to run their analyses in the UK.

Additional wrapper and JSON registration are needed.

Please submit pull request and issue related to the OCSI software itself on the parent repository, issues related to the Agave application here.
